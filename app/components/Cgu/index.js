          difficulty in the interpretation in relation to any of the titles
          appearing at the<br />head of the clauses and any of the clauses
          themselves, the titles shall be declared non-<br />existent.<br />NULLITY<br />The
          nullity of one clause does not entail the nullity of the GCU, with the
          exception of an<br />essential and fundamental clause that was
          decisive in one of the Parties entering into the<br />contract. The
          cancelled stipulation(s) shall be deemed null and void.<br />NO WAIVER<br />No
          failure or delay on the part of any Party hereto in exercising any
          right, power or remedy<br />thereunder shall operate as a waiver
          thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any<br />such
          right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof
          or the exercise of<br />any other right, power or remedy. Any waiver
          granted thereunder must be in writing and shall<br />be valid only in
          the specific instance in which given.
